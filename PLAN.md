### Deliverables
✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** - All build issues resolved!

**Recent Fix Summary (July 14, 2025):**
- **Issue**: `.load()` method called on non-atomic `PerformanceMetrics` fields
- **Root Cause**: `getMetrics()` returns `PerformanceMetrics` (non-atomic) but code tried to use atomic methods
- **Solution**: Removed `.load()` calls from non-atomic fields in both `performance_monitor.cpp` and `main.cpp`
- **Additional Fix**: Replaced `std::atomic<double>::fetch_add` with mutex-protected operations for C++17 compatibility
- **Build Environment**: Successfully builds with C++17 using system libraries
- **Runtime Fix**: Uses `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to avoid conda library conflicts

**Build Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL**
- Main application: `/workspaces/Synthetic_Arbitrage_Detectio_Engine/build/SyntheticArbitrageEngine`
- Unit tests: `/workspaces/Synthetic_Arbitrage_Detectio_Engine/build/tests/unit_tests`
- All core functionality working: configuration loading, logging, performance monitoring
- Performance metrics collection: ✅ Working (messages, opportunities, latency, memory, CPU)
- Signal handling: ✅ Working (graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C)

**Current System Status**:
- C++17 build system working perfectly
- All Phase 1 foundation components implemented and tested
- Configuration system loading from `config/engine_config.json`
